## TIG Overlap problem

# Problem: The Gulfwide TIG dataset overlaps spatially and temporally with other datasets
#   such that some colonies in the Atlas are surveyed/counted more than once per year
#   by two different data providers.
# Proposed solution: Pull out TIG colonies that are overlapping and put them in their
#   own separate dataset. This will be done here by creating a new column called "TIGDisplay". 
#   Rows to be displayed together will be assigned "together" and those to be 
#   displayed separately will be assigned "separate".
# Steps: 
#   First select colonies that are within a 500-m distance threshold.
#   Next select colonies where TIG colony name is the same as in other datasets.
#   Then, for those colonies that are to be displayed separately,
#   check temporal overlap: if no overlap, send back to be displayed together.
