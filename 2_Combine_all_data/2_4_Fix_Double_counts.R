## 4_Fix_Double_counts.R
## Double count problem 

# Some of these problems are because there are rows w presence/absence in SpCountMethod and 1/0 for metric. 
# 2016 seems to be the big year for this problem. Presence/Absence rows are dropped below. 
# There are then other rows that have actual counts. 
# Some of these is that each metric of multiple metrics is in its own row.
# I think this is a result of different groups counting different metrics 
# and/or different SpCountMethod or SurveyVantagePoint. 
# Metrics are combined into a single row below. 
# For others, it is likely the site was visited 2+ times in a year. 
# For these, I took the max count as was done in the FL Seabird database.
# This only impacted a few rows.
