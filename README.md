As of 12 December 2024, this repository has moved to https://doi.org/10.5066/P14SQSCU

The new repository "Atlas of Breeding Sites for Waterbirds in the Northern Gulf of Mexico" shares R scripts  used to assess and control the quality of breeding survey datasets, clean those datasets, and combine them into a coherent structure.

This repository remains in use to host the file `index.html`, which is embedded in the Atlas user interface, and which provides details of the methodology used to create the Atlas.
